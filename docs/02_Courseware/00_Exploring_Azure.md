## Objective
The first objective is simply for you to become familiar with connecting to and navigating the Azure portal.  

## Azure Portal Basics
Let's start by connecting to the Azure portal and becoming familiar with navigation.

  1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://www.azure.com](http://www.azure.com).

  2. In the top-right corner of your screen, you will see the menu option **PORTAL**. Click on it.
  
  3. If you have not already, you will be required to authenticate.
  
  4. After authentication is successful, you will be directed to your _Dashboard_. The dashboard is configurable by adding, removing and resizing _tiles_.  Additionally, you can have multiple dashboards depending on your preferences.  You could have different dashboards for resources dedicated to different functions, lines of business, or for operations.

  5. On the left will be your primary navigational menu. You should see a list of favorited services on the menu with descriptions.  (NOTE: The size of your menu may differ from that of others depending on the number of services you have selected as a favorite.) If the only thing you see are icons (no descriptions) on your menu, your menu is currently collapsed.  Click the "hamburger" <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureWorkshops/images/master/icons_hamburger.jpg" style="display: inline; margin:0px 5px;box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #999;border:1px solid #ccc;"/> to expand it. 

  6. Pretty close to the top of your menu, you should see **Resource Groups** <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureWorkshops/images/master/icons_resource_groups.jpg" style="display: inline; margin:0px 5px;box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #999;border:1px solid #ccc;"/>. Click this option.

  7. Upon clicking the Resource Groups menu item, a _blade_ will open revealing any created resource groups. In order to create resources in Azure, you must assign/place it in a resource group.

This is where we will get started creating our resources.
