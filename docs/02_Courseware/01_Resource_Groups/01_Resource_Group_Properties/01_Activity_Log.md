## Overview
Let's briefly explore how to query the history around our Resource Group.

## Activity Log
Once you've created a Resource Group or you click on a Resource Group, the first tab **Overview** is selected.  Of course, there's no resources created yet.  We'll create some momentarily.  For now, in the left panel, click on **Activity log** <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureWorkshops/images/master/icons_activity_log.jpg" class="inline"/>.

The Activity Log gives you a report of all events within your Resource Group.  At the top of the query window, you'll see various options to customize your query.  Additionally, you can choose to save frequent search parameters.

There's, of course, not much to see here are this time. But, as we complete this workshop, you can revisit this blade periodically to see the changes to your Resource Group.
